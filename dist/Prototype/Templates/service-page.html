          <p class="about-data__desc about-data__desc--less">I strive to form a long term relationship with patients and their families. In my field, quite a few are ultimately diagnosed with chronic conditions. Being able to build a strong bond over our time together, along with being given the honor to be the treating physician by these families, is an aspect I consider most satisfying and rewarding.In my years of practice so far I get to appreciate first hand just how tough and resilient my patients- infants, children and teenagers can be.  This is something that absolutely blows my mind and keeps me motivated even more so for them and their families on a daily basis. It ultimately has given me my passion and helped me form a philosophy and values through which I approach medicine.</p>
          <p class="about-data__desc">Outside of work, my family is what makes a large part of who I am. I have a wonderful, supportive husband who I am very grateful for.  I also have a newly minted toddler, who definitely keeps us on our toes, along with her fur brother. We enjoy family time of course but winter time in PA is special to us as it is a wonderful time for us to enjoy skiing, one of our favorite hobbies. We hope to get the little one on skis one day soon. Right now she is just an avid walker.

            Lastly, although not done recently, we would love to get back into traveling and seeing the world. The Mediterranean is on our bucket list as a family, and I am hoping to get some checks next to a few of our destinations in the next few years to come.</p>

                <div class="vid-content">I love when to hear my patient’s say, “you made me feel whole again,” or “I finally see myself the way I’ve always wanted to.”  Whether it’s giving a patient something back that’s been taken from them, or giving them a sense of rejuvenation, it is a feeling that is unique to the practice of plastic surgery. It’s what inspires me to help my patients look in the mirror with a sense of confidence about the person they see looking back.</div></div>
