          Excellent Care for Babies and Their Families in the St. Luke’s NICUs
        </h3>

          Thanks to advances in reproductive medicine and pre-natal care, more
          women today are able to conceive, maintain pregnancies, and deliver
          babies – even premature and multiple births. Sometimes, however, these
          babies have special needs that require high quality medical care
          enhanced with the latest technology. Even when the pregnancy has been
          problem free, babies can be born with unexpected conditions that
          require expert care. The St. Luke’s Neonatal Intensive Care Units
          (NICU) at St. Luke’s Allentown Campus, St. Luke’s University Hospital
          – Bethlehem and St. Luke’s Anderson Campus are designed to provide a
          high level of care for babies and their families.
