        <div class="vid-content">I love when to hear my patient’s say, “you made me feel whole again,” or “I finally see myself the way I’ve always wanted to.”  Whether it’s giving a patient something back that’s been taken from them, or giving them a sense of rejuvenation, it is a feeling that is unique to the practice of plastic surgery. It’s what inspires me to help my patients look in the mirror with a sense of confidence about the person they see looking back.</div></div>
